# Release guide

This guide describes how to release stimpool on Github and Pypi.

1. Create new branch named `bump-stimpool-version-[version-number]`.
2. Add a label to the branch that describes the part of the version number that
   will be bumped. Possible parts are major, minor, and patch.
3. Bump the version

      $ poetry run invoke version part  # possible: major / minor / patch

4. Document changes in the CHANGELOG.md (only a summary)

5. Commit the changes

        $ git add .
        $ git commit

6. Push the tags to Github

      $ git push
      $ git push --tags

7. If all checks pass in the ci, merge this branch into the master branch.

8. Complete the final version of the latest release draft on GitHub. This draft was
   automatically generated by release-drafter.
   - Make sure the version and tag associated with it is correct
   - Add a summary of the changes
   - Revise the draft and make any appropriate changes
9. Publish the draft on GitHub
