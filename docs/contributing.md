### Report Bugs
  You can report bugs at <https://github.com/mario-bermonti/stimpool/issues>.

  Please provide all the details that are asked when you create the issue to make sure
  it is understood correctly.

### Fix existing bugs

  Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with \"bug\"
  and \"help wanted\" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with
\"enhancement\" and \"help wanted\" is open to whoever wants to
implement it.

## Start contributing!

### Set up the development environment

Ready to contribute? Here\'s how to set up
stimpool in your local development environment.

You will need [Python 3.6+][download_python] installed.

1.  Fork the [stimpool repo][stimpool_gh] on GitHub.
2.  Clone your fork locally:

        git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/stimpool.git

3. We use `poetry` to manage dependencies. Install it with the following command.

        curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -

4.  Install the project, its dependencies, and the virtualenv:

         poetry install

5. Make sure everything is working properly before making any changes by running `poetry run invoke dev-tasks`.

### Development tasks (important side note)
In order to run anything inside the virtual environment every command has to be prefixed with `poetry run <command>`.

For example, to run python inside the virtual environment you would run `poetry run python`.

We have most of our development tasks pre-configured to run automatically with invoke.  :grin:

The most important tasks are:

| Command   | Description                |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| dev-tasks | Run all development tasks. |
| format    | Format code.               |
| tests     | Run tests.                 |
| coverage  | Create coverage report.    |
| lint      | Run all linting.           |
| mypy      | Run mypy.                  |
| docs      | Build documentation.       |
| clean     | Run all clean sub-tasks.   |



You can find see all the development tasks that pre-configured by running `poetry run invoke --list`.

### Making changes

#### Workflow

We work by protecting `master` branch and only merging changes that don't break existing functionality and are tested.

How do we do it?:

1. We identify something that must change
2. We create an issue on GitHub, if it doesn't already exist
3. We create a new branch named after the issue we want "fix" (`issue-$TASKNUMBER`)
4. We make changes and test everything works
5. Style the code
6. We then create a pull request to `master` branch that is reviewed and if approved, it is merged
   into `master`

This way we achieve an easy and scalable development process that avoids merge
conflicts and long-living branches.

In this method, the `master` branch always has the latest working version of the software, is stable,
and is working.

#### How to make changes

Follow this steps when working on changes to the project. Please see the `Workflow section` for
important details about making changes.

1.  Create a branch for local development. All the changes must be in this branch.

        $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

2. Run the all checks to make sure everything is working before making
   any changes

        $ poetry run invoke dev-tasks

3. Add any changes you want
3. Add tests for the new changes
4. Run the tests and make sure they all pass

        $ poetry run invoke tests

4. Edit the documentation if appropriate (this is required for new features)
5. Make sure the changes to the documentation are correct and that the docs build

        $ poetry run invoke docs

6. Make sure everything is fine (e.g., tests, code style, coverage)

        $ poetry run invoke dev-tasks

   If you find that something is not working as expected, fix it, check that it is working appropriately
   by running the appropriate invoke command (see `Development tasks section`).

        $ poetry run invoke <command>

   After it is fixed, run all development tasks again

        $ poetry run invoke dev-tasks

7.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

        $ git add .
        $ git commit

    Stimpool follows specific guidelines for commit messages:

    - Make a reference to the relevant GitHub issues in your commit message (e.g., `Fix #1234`)
      We use imperative mood for commit messages (`fix x`, instead of `fixed x`).
      See [this commit guide][commit_guide]. A tip is to use a title for your commit message
      that completes "This commit will..." [Fix issue X].
    - The subject line should have < 80 chars
    - Leave one line blank
    - [Optional] Explain any relevant details or decisions made

8. Push your changes to GitHub

        $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

9.  Submit a pull request through GitHub (see the `Pull Request Guidelines` section).

#### Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1.  The pull request should include tests for new functionality.
2.  If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
3.  The pull request should pass all tests and must work for all the supported Python versions. It
    must also pass all checks in the GitHub CI.

Feel free to submit your pull request early so we can discuss it and iterate on the process.

### Tips

We really value your contributions and want to integrate your changes. The following are tips to
improve the probability that your changes are accepted.

- Make sure they don't break existing functionality
- Include tests for the changes you made
- Commit often
- Make small, easy to understand commits (i.e., atomic commits)
- Keep your changes in the narrowest scope possible (e.g., create tutorial for using the `X object`)
- It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything. This will allow a chance to
  talk it over with the maintainers and validate your approach.
